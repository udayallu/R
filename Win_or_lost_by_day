Assign to the variable total_daily how much you won or lost on each day in total (poker and roulette combined).
# Casino winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate your daily earnings: total_daily
total_daily <- poker_vector + roulette_vector
